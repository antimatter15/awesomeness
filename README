What is awesomeness?
Well, its really not that awesome and probably won't work but the idea is pretty simple.

Any HTTP server can host messages. Messages can be any length and can be updated by multiple people*.

* People are proxied by providers who handle things like message aggregation, search, authentication, etc.

Basically, you can be a user at admin@antimatter15.com and create messages on blahblah.com/ladfjfasdlkfj (if that site grants you permission).

The metadata includes a list of children (and history of operations applied if OT is supported in the future). The tree can be traversed at any point to give something.
